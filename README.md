# SA GWAS (2018)

#### 1. Phenotype and quant. gen analysis

-Male and female fitness data QC

-Estimation of male and female heritability using animal model (MCMCglmm)

-Estimation of intersexual genetic correlation for fitness

-Definition of an antagonistic index

-Male and female fitness plot + antagonistic index overlay

#### 2. Genotype quality control

-Depth and GQ filtering

-MAF and call rate filtering

-PCA including outgroup population (DGRP) to identify outliers

-Examination of pairwise relatedness between individuals

#### 3. LHm pop gen

-LD in LHm

-PCA within LHm

#### 4. Association mapping

-LDAK mixed model association analysis

-Manhattan plot

-P-value histogram

-FDR estimation

-QQ-plot

-Permutation-based analysis

-LD clumping

#### 5. Functional analyses

-SNP heritability of antagonistic index

-Partitioning heritability into 1/2 genome

-Partitioning heritability into autosome vs. X

-Partitioning heritability into variant effect categories

-Candidate vs. non candidate comparisons by X/A and variant effect cateogries

#### 6. SNP-based bal sel analyses

-Convert recombination rate and linked selection estimates to r6

-Convert Genome Nexus dasta files to vcf format and r6 coordinates

-Estimate allele frequencies across populations, including sites that are monomorphic in the population but polymorphic in LHm

-Ant. vs. control MAF spectrum

-Ant. vs. control "matched" analysis

-MAF for independent SNPs across whole spectrum of P-values

#### 7. Window-based bal sel analyses
